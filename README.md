# Computer Graphics College Mini Project
## Introduction:
  This project aims to showcase the application of computer graphics concepts using the BGI(Borland Graphics Interface) to create visually appealing and interactive 2D     graphics.

## Prerequisites
  Turbo C++

### Note : BGI and graphics.h were deprecated a long time ago but IOE says use it or you don't get marks.xD

## How to run :
  1. Download the source file or copy the code
  2. Move the file inside the installation diretory of turboC (eg :- "c:\turboc3\bin\") using a file manager  
  3. Rename to all caps (CLOCK.C or WHATEVER.C)
  4. Open the file in turbo C and run.

## The output should look like this:
  (Takes the current time from your system and displays as analog clock with real-time clock hands.
  And the pendulum oscillates back and forth too.)
